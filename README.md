# NASA Asteroid Classification
Training classification models on the NASA asteroid dataset to predict hazardous asteroids.

Models trained and accuracy scores (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity):
1. Logistic Regression: 96.48%
2. K-Nearest Neighbors: 90.72%
3. Naive Bayes: 94.67%
4. SVM: 96.91%
5. Kernel SVM: 94.99%
6. Decision Tree Classification: 99.36%
7. Random Forest Classification: 99.04%

This project was developed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides a free cloud-based environment for running Jupyter notebooks. This Notebook can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/angelakorm/nasa-asteroid-classification/blob/main/Asteroid_Classification.ipynb). 

This project uses the NASA Asteroids Classification dataset, originally sourced from [NASA](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/) and curated for public use on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lovishbansal123/nasa-asteroids-classification) by Lovish Bansal.
